## Frontend MVP

- Ability to add, complete, delete and edit todos
  Services File
- Typescript & testing with React Test Library
- All errors must be handled and passed on properly back to the user (toast notifications are a good way of doing this)

- Must look polished, there is an example image attached to this spec and there are hundreds of examples of good looking todo apps online

## Backend MVP

- All endpoints must be error handled such that they return the correct status codes and messages.
- Implement a logging strategy for requests being processed (there are loads of recourse you can find via google to do this)
- Use spring swagger to generate documentation for your API
